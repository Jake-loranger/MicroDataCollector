# MicroDataCollector
A testing app that (1) connects to a microcontroller via bluetooth (2) reads and stores info via CoreData (3) analyzes and graphs the data in real-time using SwiftUI and Charts.

This project is being used as a testing apparatus for a senior capstone. The goal of the capstone is to obtain, analyze, and display vital biometric information to pilots mid-flight. This apparatus enabled the recording and displaying of temperature data, as well as allow for the learning of essential software development skills.
